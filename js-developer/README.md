# The Gaming Innovation Group JavaScript Challenge

## Client Side Address Book
Build a [Single Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPA) address book using Typescript, HTML and CSS.

### Functionality
1. There should be one view where all contacts are listed.
1. There should be another view to add, delete and edit contacts.
1. The data should be persisted (on the client), and loaded again when the application starts.
1. Add fitting validation to the different input fields.

### Form Fields
* First name (input, required)
* Last name (input, required)
* Email (input[type=text], required, valid email)
* Country (dropdown, required) - use the [country-list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/country-list) module to populate the list

### Other Requirements
We want to see what you are capable of and this is why we are giving you a lot of freedom to approach the challenge. We not only want to see your code but also your technical assesment of the problem, architectural decision making and technology choices. Please keep the following in mind.

* Even though this is a small project, **structure and architecture should mimic a large project**.
* The code should obviously follow best practises (DRY, maintainable, testable, etc.).
* Feel free to depend on any frameworks/libraries you think is suitable using NPM.
* We want the code you submit to be written by you, so don’t use skelletons/generators.
* Make sure the application works on Node 10.x, NPM 6.x and in latest Chrome and Firefox.

Note, this is where you get to shine — *show us what you’ve got!*
